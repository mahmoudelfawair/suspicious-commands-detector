Certainly! Here's a simple README file that you can include with your script to explain its purpose and usage:

### Script: Suspicious Command Execution Monitor

#### Overview
This PowerShell script monitors Windows Security event logs for suspicious command executions and sends an email notification if detected.

#### Requirements
- PowerShell version compatible with `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet.
- Access to Windows Security event logs (`Security` log) to read event ID 4688.

#### Configuration
1. **Variables to Fill Out:**
   - `$From`: Sender email address for notifications.
   - `$To`: Recipient email address to receive notifications.
   - `$SMTPServer`: SMTP server address for sending emails.
   - `$SMTPUsername`: Username for SMTP server authentication.
   - `$SMTPPassword`: Password for SMTP server authentication.
   
2. **Events to Monitor:**
   - Add suspicious commands to the `$suspicious` array. The script checks for these commands in executed processes.

3. **Running the Script:**
   - Ensure the script is executed in an environment where it can access Windows Security event logs (`Security` log).
   - Adjust the script's execution frequency (currently set to check every 5 minutes) using the `Start-Sleep` command.

#### Usage
1. Save the script to a secure location on your Windows system.
2. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script by entering `.\YourScriptName.ps1`.

#### Example
Assuming the script is saved as `MonitorSuspiciousCommands.ps1`, you can run it in PowerShell as follows:

```powershell
.\MonitorSuspiciousCommands.ps1
```

#### Notes
- Ensure SMTP server details (`$SMTPServer`, `$SMTPUsername`, `$SMTPPassword`) are correct and valid for sending emails.
- Customize HTML email formatting or add additional logging or actions as needed.
